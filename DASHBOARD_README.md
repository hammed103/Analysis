- `Data/merged_ev_ads_dataset_20250716_170109.csv`

### Required Columns
The CSV file should contain:
- `country`: Market information (Portugal, Germany, Netherlands)
- `matched_cars`: Vehicle model names
- `openai_analysis`: AI-generated feature analysis
- `start_date`: Advertisement start dates
- `page_name`: Advertiser information
- `vehicle_model`: Vehicle model (fallback for matched_cars)

## Running the Dashboard

## Data Processing

The dashboard uses the updated `EVAdvertAnalyzer` class which:

1. **Prioritizes new column structure**:
   - Uses `country` over `targeted_countries_list`
   - Uses `matched_cars` over `matched_car_models`
   - Uses `openai_analysis` over `openai_summary`

2. **Filters for target data**:
   - Markets: Portugal, Germany, Netherlands
   - Vehicles: Hyundai Ioniq 5, VW ID.4, Renault Megane E-Tech, Audi Q4 e-tron, Tesla Model Y

3. **Extracts structured features**:
   - Parses **Section:** format from OpenAI analysis
   - Categorizes features into meaningful groups
   - Filters out low-quality content

## Performance Notes

- Data is cached using `@st.cache_data` for faster loading
- Large datasets may take a few seconds to process initially
- Time series analysis may show timezone warnings (cosmetic only)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No data file found"**: Ensure one of the expected CSV files exists
2. **Empty charts**: Check if data matches the expected column structure
3. **Slow loading**: Large datasets may take time to process initially
